**AFAbstractRESTClient** is simple abstract solution to deal with REST webservices using AFNetworking.
It basically adds some structure to API calls by separating each type of operation to a class.

In classical approach one can use [fa√ßade pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) to create a fat client with API methods.

This solution is based on [Template method pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern) and allows developers to create API calls 'on-the-fly'. 

Typical HTTP request consists of a few steps:
* create request with address
* decorate request with authentication etc.
* add asynchronous task with request
* parse response data or display error
* return data to calling block

They can all be combined into one abstract task, which only asks for some information that's missing.
E.g. GET request asks only for `path` and calls `parseData` when request is completed.

Examples for GET and POST requests are included in Tests.

## How to get started
- Download AFAbstractRESTClient
- call `pod install` to install required AFNetworking
- if you have never used [cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/) remember to open `AFAbstractRESTClient.xcworkspace` rather than `AFAbstractRESTClient.xcodeproj`
- see `AFAbstractRESTClientTests.m` file with example test/usages for GET and POST requests
- run tests by pressing `Cmd+U`
- use in your own project if you like :)

##Example GET Call
* create class that inherits from AbstractGETAPICall and override **only required methods**:

``` objective-c
#import "AbstractGETAPICall.h"

@interface GithubGETCall : AbstractGETAPICall

@end
```
``` objective-c
#import "GithubGETCall.h"

@implementation GithubGETCall

- (NSString*) path {
    return @"https://api.github.com/repos/burczyk/AFAbstractRESTClient";
}

- (void) parseResponseData: (id) JSON withSuccessBlock:(void (^)(id JSON)) blockSuccess {
    // You can parse your data here, e.g. write them to Core Data/SQLite or create your own model.
    // After parsing you can return either JSON or parsed object as input for block is (id)
    blockSuccess(JSON);
}

@end
```

* use it anywhere in your code in simple way:

``` objective-c
GithubGETCall *call = [[GithubGETCall alloc] init];
[call executeAPICallWithSuccessBlock:^(id responseObject) {
	
} failure:^(NSError *error, id responseObject) {
    
}];
```
